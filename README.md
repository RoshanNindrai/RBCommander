If you want to install manually, copy the RBCommander folder to the project director.

The Command
============

A command is a DTO that carries the instruction needed to perform a specific business login.

The CommandHandler
============

The command handler uses the Command DTO object and performs a set of operations over or along the object. The CommandHandler conforms to RBHandlerProtocol

The CommandBus
============

The command bus uses the command translator to map a specific command to its handler class, and executes commands that are issues to it.

Note
============

By default, the command bus will do a quick search and replace on the name of the command class to figure out which handler class to use for example

LoginCommand => LoginCommandHandler
